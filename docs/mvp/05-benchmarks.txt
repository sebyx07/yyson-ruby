YYJson MVP: Comprehensive Benchmarking Suite
============================================

Inspired by: Oj's perf_*.rb suite + zsv-ruby benchmarks

[X] Set up benchmark framework
    [X] Use benchmark-ips gem for iterations/sec
    [X] Create benchmark/support/data_generator.rb for test data
    [X] Generate various JSON payloads (small, medium, large, nested)
    [X] Create benchmark/support/helpers.rb for common utilities

[X] Create benchmark/parse_simple.rb - Basic parsing
    [X] Small JSON object (< 1KB)
    [X] Medium JSON object (10-100KB)
    [X] Large JSON array (1MB+)
    [X] Deeply nested structures
    [X] Compare: YYJson vs JSON gem vs Oj vs Yajl-ruby
    [X] Show iterations/sec and relative speedup

[ ] Create benchmark/parse_rails.rb - Rails-like data
    [X] ActiveRecord-style JSON (array of objects)
    [X] Timestamps (ISO8601 strings)
    [X] Mixed types (strings, numbers, nulls, booleans)
    [X] Typical API response format
    [ ] Compare with mode: :rails

[X] Create benchmark/generate_simple.rb - Basic generation
    [X] Hash → JSON
    [X] Array → JSON
    [X] Nested structures → JSON
    [X] Compare: YYJson vs JSON gem vs Oj vs MultiJson
    [X] Pretty vs compact output

[ ] Create benchmark/generate_rails.rb - Rails serialization
    [ ] Simulate ActiveRecord .to_json
    [ ] Include as_json() calls
    [ ] Benchmark with ActiveSupport loaded
    [ ] Compare optimized vs unoptimized

[ ] Create benchmark/memory.rb - Memory profiling
    [ ] Use memory_profiler gem
    [ ] Measure allocated objects during parse
    [ ] Measure allocated objects during generate
    [ ] Compare frozen vs unfrozen strings
    [ ] Show memory savings from pre-allocation
    [ ] Verify smart allocation is working

[X] Create benchmark/round_trip.rb - Parse + generate
    [X] Load JSON → modify → dump JSON
    [X] Measure total time
    [X] Real-world usage pattern

[ ] Create benchmark/file_io.rb - File operations
    [ ] load_file() vs File.read + parse
    [ ] dump_file() vs generate + File.write
    [ ] Large file handling (100MB+ JSON)

[ ] Add comparison benchmarks
    [ ] benchmark/vs_json.rb - vs standard JSON gem
    [ ] benchmark/vs_oj.rb - vs Oj gem
    [ ] benchmark/vs_yajl.rb - vs Yajl-ruby
    [ ] Show feature comparison table

[ ] Create realistic benchmarks
    [ ] benchmark/api_response.rb - REST API JSON
    [ ] benchmark/config_file.rb - Large config JSON
    [ ] benchmark/logs.rb - JSON log entries
    [ ] benchmark/geojson.rb - GeoJSON data

[ ] Document benchmark results
    [ ] Create docs/BENCHMARKS.md
    [ ] Include graphs/charts of results
    [ ] Show speedup multipliers (e.g., "3.5x faster")
    [ ] Break down by operation (parse/generate)
    [ ] Include memory comparison charts
    [ ] Show performance across Ruby versions (3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)

[ ] Set up continuous benchmarking
    [ ] Add rake benchmark task
    [ ] Run on CI for performance regression detection
    [ ] Compare against previous version
    [ ] Alert on > 10% slowdown

[ ] Verify performance goals
    [ ] Faster than JSON gem (target: 2-5x)
    [ ] Competitive with Oj (target: within 20%)
    [ ] Lower memory usage (target: 30-50% reduction)
    [ ] Faster Rails integration than alternatives
